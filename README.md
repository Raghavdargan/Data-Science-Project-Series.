### Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various medical attributes.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

### Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

### Modeling
Various machine learning models were used, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

### Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% with a recall of Y%.

## Stock Price Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock prices from [source].

### Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and patterns in the stock prices.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling features.

### Modeling
Various machine learning models were used, including Linear Regression, Naive Bayes , XGBOOST, Random Forest

### Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Results
The best-performing model achieved an RMSE of X.
