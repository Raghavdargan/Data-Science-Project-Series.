## Project Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using various machine learning models. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and (optionally) deployment.

## Dataset

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure, features, and size of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the distribution of sentiment labels.
4. **Text Vectorization:** Convert text data into numerical vectors.
5. **Model Selection:** Explore and implement various machine learning models.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model performance.

8. **Model Interpretability:** Understand the key features contributing to model predictions.
9. **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
10. **Deployment (Optional):** Deploy the model for real-time sentiment analysis.
11. **Documentation:** Document the entire process, including code and visualizations.

## Data Exploration
We explore the Sentiment Analysis dataset to understand its structure, key variables, and distribution of sentiment labels.

## Data Preprocessing
We perform text preprocessing tasks, including lowercasing, removing stop words, handling special characters, tokenization, and lemmatization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conduct EDA to visualize the distribution of sentiment labels using histograms and count plots to understand the balance of sentiment classes.

## Text Vectorization
We convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

## Model Selection
We explore different machine learning models, including Naive Bayes and XGBoost, and evaluate their performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
We fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models using techniques like grid search to optimize performance.

## Cross-Validation
We implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization performance and prevent overfitting.

## Model Interpretability
We interpret the model's predictions by analyzing feature importance and using techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

## Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
### XGBoost Results
- **Accuracy:** 81.84%
- **Precision:** 78.98%
