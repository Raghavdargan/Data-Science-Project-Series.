# Combined Machine Learning Projects: Breast Cancer Prediction, Stock Price Prediction, and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains three separate machine learning projects:
1. Breast Cancer Prediction
2. Stock Price Prediction
3. Sentiment Analysis

Each project includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and results.

## Breast Cancer Prediction
  
  ### Project Overview
  This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various medical attributes.

  ### Dataset
  The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

  ### Data Exploration
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

  ### Data Preprocessing
  Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

  ### Modeling
  Various machine learning models were used, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

  ### Evaluation Metrics
  Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

  ### Results
  The best-performing model SVC acheived an accuracy of 96%.

  ## Stock Price Prediction
  
  ### Project Overview
  This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data.

  ### Dataset
  The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock prices from [source].

  ### Data Exploration
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and patterns in the stock prices.

  ### Data Preprocessing
  Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling features.

  ### Modeling
  Various machine learning models were used, including Linear Regression, Naive Bayes , XGBOOST, Random Forest

  ### Evaluation Metrics
  Models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

  ### Results
  The best-performing model Random forest acheived an accuracy of 76%

  ## Sentiment Analysis
   ### Project Overview
   This project  involves determining the emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral) behind text data to gain insights into opinions or attitudes.
   ### Dataset
   The dataset used for this project contains tweets, where each tweet is labeled with its sentiment. The dataset includes attributes such as text, sentiment, age of user, time of tweet, and other demographic information related to the user.

   ### Data Exploration
   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset and relationships between text features and sentiment. Visualizations such as word clouds, bar plots, and correlation matrices were used to gain insights into the data.

   ### Data Preprocessing
   The data preprocessing steps include:

   Text cleaning: Removing special characters, stopwords, URLs, and handles from the tweets.
   Tokenization: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.
   Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.
   Vectorization: Converting the text data into numerical form using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the importance of words in the context of sentiment prediction.

   ### Modeling
   Several machine learning models were applied to predict sentiment, including:

   Logistic Regression: A baseline linear model for classification.
   Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, used for text classification.
   Decision Trees: A model that splits the data based on feature values to predict sentiment.
   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): A powerful ensemble method for capturing complex patterns and interactions in the data.
  Evaluation Metrics
  The models were evaluated using:

  Accuracy: To measure the percentage of correctly predicted sentiments.
  Precision: To evaluate how many of the predicted positive sentiments are actually positive.
  Recall: To assess how many of the actual positive sentiments were correctly identified.
  F1 Score: A balanced measure of precision and recall, useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
  
  ### Results
  The best-performing model, XGBoost, achieved an accuracy of 80%,
